  externalInputVoltage:
    type: integer
    description: |+
      device input voltage, to a resolution of 0.2 Volts in integer format, supporting a maximum of 51.0V.  The integer value should be multiplied by 0.2 to recover the actual input voltage

      e.g. integer value of 69 = 13.8V  (69 multiplied by 0.2 = 13.8V)
       integer value of 150 = 30.0V  (150 multiplied by 0.2 = 30.0V)

      Note that a value of zero volts is valid, since the device has an internal battery and can operate with no external power present.


  internalBackUpBatteryLevel:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The charge level of the internal battery as a percentage in integer format.  A value of 100 therefore represents a fully charged battery
