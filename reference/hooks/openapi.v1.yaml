        Subscribe to your device's reports and get their status in real-time. The system will POST you at the URL you provide every time that a new report arrives from one of your devices.

        Please take notice that a callback is defined for this hook in this same `.yml` file, even though you are not able to see it in the browser. Please inspect the raw OpenAPI definition files to obtain information about the schema used for notifying your applications.
