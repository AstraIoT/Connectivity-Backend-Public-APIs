# Astra Connectivity APIs

This set of APIs provide connectivity to Astra Telematics devices. As an interested party, you are free to use these APIs.

## A note on this documentation

Please notice that the APIs are defined in multiple `.yaml` files that are interlinked between themselves. Please also notice that browser renders and visualizations of these API files **may** or **may not** support the full spectrum of features that the OpenAPI v3.0.2 specification, which is what this documentation is based on, provides (we're thinking links, callbacks, etc.). We advise you check the raw `.yaml` code before making any important technical decisions regarding the implementation of the APIs.

## Set up

The setup process is fairly simple, but it requires that you contact Astra Connectivity so that we can set you up a user on the backend and give you an API key.

From there, you can start making API calls to all the devices that you own (as long as you have subscribed those to the connectivity program).
