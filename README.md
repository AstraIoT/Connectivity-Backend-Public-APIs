# Astra Connectivity APIs
This set of APIs provide connectivity to Astra Telematics devices. As an interested party, you are free to use these APIs.

### A note on this documentation

Please notice that the APIs are defined in multiple `.yaml` files that are interlinked between themselves. Please also notice that browser renders and visualizations of these API files **may** or **may not** support the full spectrum of features that the OpenAPI v3.0.2 specification, which is what this documentation is based on, provides. We advise you check the raw `.yaml` code before making any important technical decisions regarding the implementation of the APIs.
